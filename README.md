# VantHoffFitting



## Installation

The package is written in the open-source programming language [Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia), which can be downloaded from their [webpage](https://julialang.org/downloads/#download_julia).  

Currently, the package is not in a registry.  It must therefore be added by specifying a URL to the repository:
```julia
using Pkg; Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/bio-phys/VantHoffFitting")
```
Users of older versions of Julia may need to wrap the contents of the brackets with `PackageSpec()`.
